## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey sophistication and trust.
- Background color: Light lavender (#F3E5F5), a very desaturated variant of the primary.
- Accent color: Dark blue (#3F51B5), an analogous color used for interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a balance of modernity and readability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for short, punchy headers; use 'Inter' for longer headlines or large blocks of text.
- Use consistent, outline-style icons to represent common actions and categories.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all devices.
